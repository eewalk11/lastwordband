export default `Now we must question who we are
And what we're meant to be
In this life
I'll find some meaning

Thrust on this path of redemption
I've sworn to take knowing
This will be no easy path
But I won't break

They'll never see it coming
'Til it's too fucking late
No longer we'll be running
From this fear that they create

Don't give in to deception
You're stronger than their lies

Never lie in silence
Never accept defeat

You're so much better than this`;
