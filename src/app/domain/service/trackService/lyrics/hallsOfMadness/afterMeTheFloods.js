export default `Contort my empathy, a rotting effigy
A source of constant pain you will remain

No more will I be swept aside
No more will my voice not be heard
Shattered your walls collapse around you
Centered, a lonely worm you will remain

As we prepare for the impending flood
Forgetting all we've ever known, just to breathe

Fuck your integrity, deception is all I see
This knowledge I have gained shall not be won in vain

And now they call you from the depths of Hell
None will absolve you so well
Endless obsession with death

Somewhere beyond this world I know
Lies my promised land but I must rise to meet the day
Shot down into oblivion
This beginning is where you end

Now you lie bleeding from this world
Slow death comes creeping for your soul`;
