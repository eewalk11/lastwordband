export default `I feel it's time to raise the dead
And rethink all you've ever said
One look into your hollowed eyes
I know your breath holds only lies

I feel it's time to slip away
Today I've said all that I've got to say
Pray for mercy from an open mind
Tonight this shallow bondage dies

Who do the fuck you think you are?
You're not my world, you're not my god
As memories sink into the past
We must admit it'd never last
And in the end you realize
Take one more step and you will die
Senses lying in the past
This waking dream, it cannot last

All this time spent building to destroy
Time slowly slipping into the void

A zombified awakening
To all the pain that we have seen
Nothing rests until you're gone
This self-abuse is fucking done

All this time spent building to destroy
Time slowly slipping into the void
Cut out your heart and bleed
As I depart from needing you`;
