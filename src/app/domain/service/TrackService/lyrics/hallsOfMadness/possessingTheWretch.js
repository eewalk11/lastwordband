export default `Mind control at its finest
Severed souls walk in silence
Fearing the face of their oppression
Afraid to be the opposition

Your life holds no meaning
As long as I'm breathing
Heed my agenda
Witness the end of your hope

Possessing the wretch

I'll make you feel my anger
I'll make you fear my reign
Forever
I'll make you feel this anger
I'll make you feel my pain
Forever

Possessing the wretch

Why deny your role in this?
Rise to heights of wealth and power
Try and hide, but it is futile
Now you die`;
