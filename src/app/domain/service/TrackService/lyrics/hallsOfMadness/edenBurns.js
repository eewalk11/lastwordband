export default `A fire burns before them
Behind them a pillar of flame
Before me the gardens of Eden
Behind them a desert of waste

Let go to all you've held so dearly
Destroy your worldly cage
The truth I've seen so clearly
Memory fueling the rage

Burning the gardens of Eden
Releasing the angel that fell
Still stoking the fires that feed him
Embracing our journey through Hell

Don't despair
Conquer all
Feed the fight for freedom
Living in honor we'll grow

A fire now surrounds me
I've become the pillar of flame

No longer will I bow before your false god
I refuse to kneel like a coward`;
