How worthy you seemed 'til I learned the truth
Now I rue the day I befriended you...
Bitch

I've paid the price for destruction left in your wake
Fantasizing obstruction wholly
This fight is hopeless
Decide what you want from this ending,
Toil, feed the foul

For too long I called you brother
This mistake is done forever more

Cutting the negative from life
Gode, I tried to make this right
Now I find the guts to stand
Holding no remorse for sins committed in the wake of lies
Now I curse your life to be
Endlessly tortured and torn apart

How worthy you seemed 'til I learned the truth
My final shred of decency
Is dying with you
Murdered
