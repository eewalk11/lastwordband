My existence is laden in cruelty
Resist all you want in vain
All of your efforts are sure to be
Wasted on a deed that was fucked from the start
Carrion maggots devour this lifeless corpse of
Worlds begot by their greed, their lust,
Their lies they tell to comfort
All those that they manipulate in time

This will never be forgotten
Never again
But I will remain
Your world is wrought with your mistakes

Gather now my minions
I command you to kill in my name
All of your lives are sure to be
Wasted on my will be done
Your life is worthless and fucked
Heed my will and suffer in my rise
To elevate yourself once before you die
See the marks and scars from all of your deeds

Pray for blood to hit the floor before words are spoken
This is my declaration of war before the world's sure demise

Creeping deeper into my dominion
Reaping your souls for fun
In this I will be taking pleasure
Your thoughts are mine for me to make
Dead hearts roam in hordes
With no sign of their retreat
Your world shall be forgotten
Your lives shall be fogotten
