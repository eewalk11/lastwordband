How will you react in the true face of evil?
Will you rise against and beseech the deceiver?

Can't you see we're falling deeper into all we consume towards obliteration?
Do what you're told, buy what you're sold, whithout any question
The common man is now the common whore

Ignorance is the bane of existence
Destroying knowledge with unyielding persistence
A fucking blow to our evolution
We must escape this mental convolusion

A silver tongue spinning lies as they turn to fact
A step too far into Hell, there's no turning back

This war is never ending
A true warrior never dies
My will I'll keep defending
No more will I devour lies

I see mankind descending
The downfall before my eyes
Is everyone so blind?
