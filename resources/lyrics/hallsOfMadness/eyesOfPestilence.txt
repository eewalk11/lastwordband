Infecting reaper, let our final plague begin
If I can't have this world, no one will
Receding deeper, into the void we call the future
All shall rot

I've shown you everything you thought you'd never know
Vast oceans of pestilence where life never grows

Die, rot, eyes of pestilence

Lucid nightmare, as greed sentenced us to death
Condemned to burn
Death is better, to wash this parasite from life
All consumed

Final hour, let our judgement now condemn
Our suicide
Plague devour, let our rivers run with blood
All defiled
