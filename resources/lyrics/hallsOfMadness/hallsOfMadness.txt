Fearing every little thing
Hopelessy languishing
We have become a husk
Of what we used to be

Now we have been stripped of
All but our existence

Legions of shambling bodies
Humanity rots at its core
Those of us left here surviving
Endlessly longing for more

Endless thoughts of sadness
Losing sense of time
Our loved ones all are leaving
All but their corpse behind

Just pray you make it through the night
To see the light of one more day
No one longs to live in Hell
But there is no other way

I don't fear my death
Just the becoming
Of walking, rotting flesh
A putrid former me

Crushed skull
Limbs splitting beside
Entrails
Exposed to the elements
Defiled
